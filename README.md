**Analyze the Existing Code in IronHack**

* Long Method

Observation: The registerUser method performs multiple tasks: input validation, user creation, database interaction, and sending emails. This violates the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).

Recommendation: Break down the registerUser method into smaller, single-purpose methods.

* Duplicate Code

Observation: Similar validation checks are repeated within the registerUser method.

Recommendation: Abstract validation logic into separate methods or a validation utility class.

* Large Class

Observation: The UserManager class handles multiple responsibilities such as user registration and authentication, violating the SRP and potentially leading to a large class with too many concerns.

Recommendation: Split the responsibilities into separate classes or services. For example, a UserService for user management and an AuthService for authentication.

* Feature Envy

Observation: The UserManager class is heavily involved in the details of Database and EmailService operations, indicating feature envy.

Recommendation: Delegate database and email operations to appropriate classes or services to reduce coupling and improve cohesion.

* Data Clumps

Observation: Parameters like firstName, lastName, email, password, and age are often used together, indicating a potential for encapsulation.
Recommendation: Encapsulate these parameters into a User data class or DTO.
